# Teluyo's Ethiopian Food Recipe

This project was one of the best projects I did for this semester. First, I want to thank my mother for helping me with the ingredients and ways of making the food. The help I got from her made it a lot easier for me to finish on time. This project helped me understand the different languages. Since what I was doing for the assignment was fully my choice, I was able to use all the resources, which made me feel confident in accessing the resources that were right for me. This project helped me build a strong confidence in my skills and made me feel confident in showing my country's food a good presentation. Thank you.
